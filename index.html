                <h5>Last Meeting of Season - Nov.7th</h5>
                <p>The last meeting of the season will be held Wednesday Nov. 7th at 6:30 PM  at the Environmental Center in downtown Bend.
                  Dawn Meiklejohn will present how to hunt, find, identify and prepare Oregon truffles.
                  I attended her talk in Eugene last year and wished I could find a truffle-sniffing dog to borrow this time of year.
                  Her recipes are excellent and the samples she had were just plain delicious.
                  November is the start of the Oregon truffle season, so her talk is very timely.
                  The season continues through the winter, though I wonder if this drought will  affect production.

                  You can certainly join NATS, North American Truffling Society, based out of Corvallis, and go with them on truffle-gathering field trips.
                  Learn more about them by visting their website: <a href=http://www.natruffling.org/>natruffling.org</a> It is great fun to attend the Truffle Festival market January 27 in Eugene or Feb. 17 in Newberg.
                  Hope to see you Nov. 7th!

                <h5>About Me</h5>
                <p>Hi! My name is Linda Gilpin.
                  In addition to running COMC, I have taken my mushroom hobby to another level by teaching a 4 week mushroom identification class every fall for over 20 years now. Mushroom hunting is a gentle sport that does little damage to the world and gets us all out into the fresh air. Be kind, and enjoy!
